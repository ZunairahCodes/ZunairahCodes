### Zunairah –– @ZunairahCodes
# 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Zunairah!
A designer specialising in type design, I'm also a **Front-end Engineer** currently polishing up my core Javascript skills through hands-on projects which I post on here for advice and feedback! I'm passionate about learning, in addition to learning programming languages, I am also learning Arabic (specifically the Gulf Dialect), French, and occasionally Swahili.  
## My Values
• 🕊️ **Community and Collaboration** are two of the greatest learning tools 

•👩🏾‍💻 Still, even with community and collaboration, real learning and growth comes from **building**, **breaking**, and **experimenting** rather than waiting for a qualification to start. 

•🪷 **Consistency over perfection**: I'd rather show up consistently and improve each time than strive for perfection and ultimately make no progress. 

## I'm currently working on...
• Learning the core principles of Javascript and React 

• Building my portfolio
